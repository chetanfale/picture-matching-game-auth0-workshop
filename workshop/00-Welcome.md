# Part 0: Welcome

![Workshop Banner Image](assets/banner.png)

Welcome to **Flip, Match, & Secure** — a hands-on workshop where you'll build a picture-matching game powered by your own Google Drive photos, all secured with Auth0's Token Vault.

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand how to give applications (and AI agents) secure, scoped access to a user's external data — without ever exposing their credentials.

---

## 💡 Learning Objectives

By completing this workshop, you will:

- **Understand the security challenge** of granting third-party code access to personal data
- **Configure Auth0 Token Vault** to securely store and manage OAuth tokens for external providers
- **Implement OAuth 2.0 connection flows** that let users link their Google account with explicit consent
- **Build secure API routes** that retrieve tokens server-side and proxy requests to Google Drive
- **Apply the principle of least privilege** by requesting only the scopes your app needs

---

## 🏗️ What You'll Build

You'll start with a fully functional memory card-matching game built with Next.js. The game works out of the box with default images, but by the end of the workshop, players will be able to:

1. **Connect their Google Drive** through a secure OAuth flow
2. **Select a folder** containing their own images
3. **Play the game** using their personal photos as card faces

All of this happens without your app ever storing Google credentials directly — Auth0 Token Vault handles that securely.
