# Screenshot Capture Guide

This guide covers all 14 images needed for the workshop. **8 app screenshots** can be captured automatically with the Playwright script. The remaining **6 images** (banner, Auth0 Dashboard, Google consent screen) must be captured manually.

**Browser window size:** 1280x800 (standard laptop viewport). The Playwright script uses this automatically. Use the same size for manual Auth0 Dashboard screenshots.

---

## Automated Capture (Playwright)

The script at `workshop/scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs` automates the 8 app screenshots. It uses a saved browser session so you only need to log in once.

### Setup

```bash
# Install Playwright (already in devDependencies)
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

### Step 1: Save your session

Start the app and log in via your normal browser. Then export the session cookie:

```bash
pnpm dev:app  # or pnpm dev:final
# Log in at http://localhost:3000 in your browser
# Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Cookies → http://localhost:3000
# Copy the "appSession" cookie value, then run:
node workshop/scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs --login
# Paste the cookie value when prompted
```

### Step 2: Capture Module 01 screenshots

Run the **starter app** (`pnpm dev:app`) on port 3000, then:

```bash
node workshop/scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs --module 01
```

Captures: `01-home-page.png`, `01-game-board.png`, `01-settings-placeholder.png`

### Step 3: Capture Module 05 screenshots

Run the **final app** (`pnpm dev:final`) on port 3000. Make sure you connected Google Drive during the `--login` step.

```bash
node workshop/scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs --module 05 --folder "Game Photos"
```

Captures: `05-settings-connected.png`, `05-settings-images-loaded.png`, `05-game-custom-photos.png`

> **Note**
> `05-settings-connect-button.png` requires Google to be **not yet connected**. Disconnect first, restart the app, and run `--module 05` without `--folder`.

---

## Manual Capture

The following images must be captured manually. Use a **1280x800** browser window.

---

## Banner Image

- [x] **`banner.png`**
  - **What:** A branded banner for the workshop
  - **Used in:** `README.md`, `00-Welcome.md`
  - **Size:** 1200x400px (3:1 wide format)
  - **Nano Banana Prompt:**

    ```
    Generate a wide workshop banner image (3:1 aspect ratio).

    The scene shows a stylized memory card-matching game board with cards
    arranged in a grid. Some cards are face-down showing a "?" symbol on a
    deep purple background, while others are flipped face-up revealing
    colorful photos of animals (a cat, a bird, a panda). A subtle golden
    shield or lock icon overlays the corner, representing security.

    Above the card grid, display the title text "Flip, Match, & Secure" in
    bold white type, with a subtitle beneath it: "Scoped Access for
    AI-Powered Games".

    Color palette: deep purple (#6C3FCF) as primary, cyan/teal (#2DB8A0) as
    secondary, golden yellow (#E8A830) as accent, on a dark navy (#1A1A2E)
    background.

    Style: Modern, clean vector illustration with subtle gradients. Developer
    workshop aesthetic — professional but playful. No photorealism. Flat
    design with slight depth and shadows on the cards.
    ```
